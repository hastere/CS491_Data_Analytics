Lab info
  Lab1 - Data cleaning and similarity calculation. Using Pandas and sklearn, this dataset is cleaned and then various similarity scores are calculated (such as jaccard, cosine). PCA is also run to reduce the dimension of the dataset.

  Lab2 - Pt1 handles the creating a decision tree classifier as well as a random forest classifier on the dataset from Lab1.
  Pt2 uses a different dataset to train 4 separate models - Decision tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, and an Artificial Neural network. These models are then compared using their respective confusion matrix as well as precision, recall, and f-score.
